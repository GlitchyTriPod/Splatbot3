I'm Splatbot!

**---CURRENT FUNCTIONS---**

**Quotes**
Splatbot can store and return Quotes on request.

*!addquote*
    -Add a quote to Splatbot using '!addquote' + the content of your quote.
        -You can optionally add a trigger to your quote by adding '-t' + your trigger at the end of the added quote.
        -For example: '!addquote LET ME IN!!! -t let me in'.
        -You can also add multiple triggers to your quotes by separating them with quotation marks!
        -Ex.: '!addquote Hewwo? -t "hello" "hi" "hey"'.
        -What do triggers do? Read more in the Chaos Mode section.
    -You can delete quotes by reacting to a quote using the :delet: emoji.

*!quote*
    -Replies to your message with a random quote!
        -Quotes are recorded on a per-server basis.

**Chaos Mode**
Chaos mode allows Splatbot to automatically respond to messages based on the trigger words added to quotes.
CHAOS MODE CAN BE VERY ANNOYING. This is intentional. Please use it with discretion.

*!chaos*
    -Toggle Chaos Mode on and off by using '!chaos ON' or '!chaos OFF'.
        -When Chaos Mode is enabled, Splatbot will read each message sent in the server and reply with a quote if the message contains the associated trigger word.
    -'!chaos CONTROL' will disable Chaos Mode and lock it for 2 hours.
    -'!chaos info' will tell you the current chaos setting for your server.

**Splatfest Generator**
Splatbot can come up with ideas for Splatfests based on topics added by YOU!!!

*!addtopic*
    -Adds a topic to Splatbot that can then be used as a part of the random Splatfest generator.

*!splatfest*
    -Generates a random Splatfest based on topics added through '!addtopic'.
