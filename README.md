I'm Splatbot!

**---CURRENT FUNCTIONS---**

**Quotes**
Splatbot can store and return Quotes on request.

*!addquote*
    -Add a quote to Splatbot using '!addquote' + the content of your quote.
        -You can optionally add a trigger to your quote by adding '-t' + your trigger at the end of the added quote.
        -For example: '!addquote LET ME IN!!! -t let me in'.
        -What do triggers do? Read more in the Chaos Mode section.

**Chaos Mode**
Chaos mode allows Splatbot to automatically respond to messages based on the trigger words added to quotes.
CHAOS MODE CAN BE VERY ANNOYING. This is intentional. Please use it with discretion.

*!chaos*
    -Toggle Chaos Mode on and off by using '!chaos ON' or '!chaos OFF'.
        -When Chaos Mode is enabled, Splatbot will read each message sent in the server and reply with a quote if the message used the correct trigger word.
    -'!chaos info' will tell you the current chaos setting for your server.

And that's it for now! I am maintained by <@216358621754294283>
